The dataframe has contains data for justices Rehnquist, Stevens,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer
for the 2000 term of the U.S. Supreme Court.  It contains data
from 43 non-unanimous cases. The votes are coded liberal (1) and
conservative (0) using the protocol of Spaeth (2003).   The unit
of analysis is the case citation (ANALU=0).  We are concerned with
formally decided cases issued with written opinions, after full
oral argument and cases decided by an equally divided vote
(DECTYPE=1,5,6,7).
