\section{{\tt matchit}: Create matched data}\label{matchit}

\subsubsection{Description}

\hlink{MatchIt}{http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/} implements the
suggestions of \cite{HoImaKin05b} for improving parametric statistical
models by preprocessing data with semi-parametric matching methods. It
uses a sophisticated array of matching methods to select well-matched
treated and control units from the original data set, thus reducing
the dependence of causal inferences on functional form and other
parametric assumptions.  After pre-processing, MatchIt output can be
used just like any other dataset in Zelig to estimate causal effects.
In this way, MatchIt improves rather than replaces existing parametric
models, reducing sensitivity to modeling assumptions.  The matching
methods available in
\hlink{MatchIt}{http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/} include exact
matching on all covariates, nearest neighbor matching,
subclassification, optimal matching, genetic matching, and full
matching.  An outline of all options are provided below; see the full
documentation (available at
\hlink{\url{http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/}}{http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/})
for more details.
