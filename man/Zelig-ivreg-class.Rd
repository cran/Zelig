\item{formula}{specification(s) of the regression relationship}

\item{instruments}{the instruments. Either \code{instruments} is missing and
formula has three parts as in \code{y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3} (recommended) or
formula is \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and instruments is a one-sided formula
\code{~ z1 + z2 + z3}. Using \code{instruments} is not recommended with \code{zelig}.}

\item{model, x, y}{logicals. If \code{TRUE} the corresponding components of the fit

\details{
Fit instrumental-variable regression by two-stage least squares. This is
equivalent to direct instrumental-variables estimation when the number of
instruments is equal to the number of predictors.

Regressors and instruments for \code{ivreg} are most easily specified in
a formula with two parts on the right-hand side, e.g.,
\code{y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3}, where \code{x1} and \code{x2} are the regressors and
\code{z1}, \code{z2}, and \code{z3} are the instruments. Note that exogenous regressors
have to be included as instruments for themselves. For example, if there is
one exogenous regressor \code{ex} and one endogenous regressor \code{en} with
instrument \code{in}, the appropriate formula would be \code{y ~ ex + en | ex + in}.
Equivalently, this can be specified as \code{y ~ ex + en | . - en + in}, i.e.,
by providing an update formula with a \code{.} in the second part of the
formula. The latter is typically more convenient, if there is a large
number of exogenous regressors.
