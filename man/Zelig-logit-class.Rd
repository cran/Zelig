\title{Logistic Regression for Dichotomous Dependent Variables}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a symbolic representation of the model to be
estimated, in the form \code{y ~ x1 + x2}, where \code{y} is the
dependent variable and \code{x1} and \code{x2} are the explanatory
variables, and \code{y}, \code{x1}, and \code{x2} are contained in the
same dataset. (You may include more than two explanatory variables,
of course.) The \code{+} symbol means ``inclusion'' not
``addition.'' You may also include interaction terms and main
effects in the form \code{x1*x2} without computing them in prior
steps; \code{I(x1*x2)} to include only the interaction term and
exclude the main effects; and quadratic terms in the form
\code{I(x1^2)}.}

\item{model}{the name of a statistical model to estimate.
For a list of other supported models and their documentation see:
\url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/}.}

\item{data}{the name of a data frame containing the variables
referenced in the formula or a list of multiply imputed data frames
each having the same variable names and row numbers (created by
\code{Amelia} or \code{\link{to_zelig_mi}}).}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{zelig},
relevant for the model to be estimated.}

\item{by}{a factor variable contained in \code{data}. If supplied,
\code{zelig} will subset
the data frame based on the levels in the \code{by} variable, and
estimate a model for each subset. This can save a considerable amount of
effort. You may also use \code{by} to run models using MatchIt
subclasses.}

\item{cite}{If is set to 'TRUE' (default), the model citation will be printed
to the console.}

\item{below}{(defaults to 0) The point at which the dependent variable is censored from below. If any values in the dependent variable are observed to be less than the censoring point, it is assumed that that particular observation is censored from below at the observed value. (See for a Bayesian implementation that supports both left and right censoring.)}

\item{robust}{defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, zelig() computes robust standard errors based on sandwich estimators (see and ) and the options selected in cluster.}

\item{if}{robust = TRUE, you may select a variable to define groups of correlated observations. Let x3 be a variable that consists of either discrete numeric values, character strings, or factors that define strata. Then
z.out <- zelig(y ~ x1 + x2, robust = TRUE, cluster = "x3", model = "tobit", data = mydata)
means that the observations can be correlated within the strata defined by the variable x3, and that robust standard errors should be calculated according to those clusters. If robust = TRUE but cluster is not specified, zelig() assumes that each observation falls into its own cluster.}
}
\value{
Depending on the class of model selected, \code{zelig} will return
  an object with elements including \code{coefficients}, \code{residuals},
  and \code{formula} which may be summarized using
  \code{summary(z.out)} or individually extracted using, for example,
  \code{coef(z.out)}. See
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/getters.html} for a list of
  functions to extract model components. You can also extract whole fitted
  model objects using \code{\link{from_zelig_model}}.

\details{
Additional parameters avaialable to this model include:
\itemize{
  \item weights: vector of weight values or a name of a variable in the dataset
  by which to weight the model. For more information see:
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/weights.html}.
  \item bootstrap: logical or numeric. If \code{FALSE} don't use bootstraps to
  robustly estimate uncertainty around model parameters due to sampling error.
  If an integer is supplied, the number of boostraps to run.
  For more information see:
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/bootstraps.html}.
